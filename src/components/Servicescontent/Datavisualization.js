    <p>Quality data is one of an organization’s most valuable assets, when used correctly. For an organization to gain the full benefits of data, they must empower business users with data visualization and visual data discovery. 
        From a technical standpoint, data visualization is simply a succinct presentation of large amounts of data and information for business users. From a business perspective, data visualization has a much deeper value for the entire organization.</p>

   
      <p>“When business users can visualize information, they’re able to process it more effectively and make faster and better decisions,” according to research conducted by the Aberdeen Group. Data visualizations unlock the power of data by facilitating a flow of information from technical departments to business users. It is not only essential to communicate this valuable information, but also to effectively use the insights to influence business users. This influence is a powerful tool in bringing about organizational change. Data visualization, when done right, 
          can be instrumental in leveraging data to achieve business objectives.</p>
         <p> Data Visualization for the Impact Effective data visualization is not about choosing the latest 
    visualization in the market; it is about choosing the right visualization that to 
    fit the audience and business goals. With the wrong visualization, the intended message 
    can be misinterpreted or lost for various reasons such as choosing a wrong chart type, 
    bad style or inappropriate granularity of information.</p>

<p>At Quadratics, we understand the unique needs of the customers and their business goals, and apply that knowledge to our data visualizations. Our professionals are not only trained in the data visualization tools to produce charts and dashboards, but also have advanced skills in user-centric design and human factors. We follow an interactive approach, working directly with customers to create visualizations that effectively communicate their messages. Our ability to understand customers’ unique needs 
    and business goals lead to data visualizations that achieve the desired impact.</p>

<p>We also have extensive experience integrating advanced data visualizations from D3JS using angular JS, SVG etc. to present data in a pictorial or graphic format rather than traditional visual representations, such as charts and maps to help business users understand information more quickly and easily.

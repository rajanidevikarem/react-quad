 The fifth pillar, Infrastructure, plays a major role in many ways. Infrastructure (which includes connectivity, communication, and continuity), data on cloud, and security:
With the advent of digital infrastructure, which has turned the world into a highly connected one, IoT, Cloud, etc., along with data, analytics and insights are now available just a click away. As the world is moving towards cloud-based infrastructure and SaaS (Software as a service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) are becoming the new norms. However, this is posing challenges on business continuity and disaster recovery. The ability to provide 24Ã—7 availability with high uptime, secured data, and disaster recovery has become very crucial.
</p>
<p>Two vulnerable aspects in Digital Services include:</p>

<ul className="check-list">
<li>Information Security</li>
<li>Business Continuity</li>

</ul>
<p> To assess risks and vulnerabilities, organizations need to carry out appropriate and timely assessments. Besides, gap analysis and vulnerability assessment exercises can be helpful too in this regard. To counter threats, there needs to be a robust cloud security framework along with business continuity and disaster recovery tools. However, it is important to identify the risks to business first so that the fixes work. 
  To recognize the threats, consider the below factors:</p>

  <ul className="check-list">
<li>Nature of business</li>
<li>Nature of assets and their vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Review of existing controls</li>
<li>Observations and interviews of employees</li>
<li>Incidents that occurred</li>
<li>Feedback and opinion of management</li>
</ul>
<p>Business impact analysis is done on a regular basis to identify the critical business processes/ infrastructure/ projects. 
  The outcome helps to assess the level of risks and criticality and impact on data and projects.</p>

 <p>People Skills and competencies, the most valuable, play an important part in ensuring delivery excellence.

Different profile people need different skill level. Define a framework that ensures that skill gaps are identified and are regularly upgraded, to improve productivity.

These competencies can be divided into:</p>
<ul className="check-list">
<li>Vertical Competencies</li>
<li>Technical Competencies</li>
<li>Functional Competencies</li>
<li>Behavioral Competencies</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework determines base-level competency requirements for each role and level, which are then assessed through tools and interviews.

Engaging people intellectually and emotionally is 
another aspect to consider. Innovation hubs, entrepreneurial initiatives, etc., 
are great employee engagement ideas.</p>

 <p>Governance is the sixth pillar, which has evolved over a period. The major components of Governance framework are:

Different profile people need different skill level. Define a framework that ensures that skill gaps are identified and are regularly upgraded, to improve productivity.

These competencies can be divided into:</p>
<ul className="check-list">
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Metrics and reporting</li>
<li>Compliance on regulations and models</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication: This is an important aspect in any governance model that comprises of different types and mechanisms of communication. A good communication plan can bridge gaps between distributed teams, 
  as is shown in the table below:

 <p>Visibility in service provision, productivity, utilization, and timelines are some of the most critical elements in an engagement. These can best be achieved via real-time visibility and usage of tools.
   </p>

   <p>Tools like JIRA offer real-time visibility to customer, sitting miles away.
Such tools provide perceptibility and allow simultaneous tracking of projects and programs in a proactive way, thereby flagging all risks and issues before they become unmanageable. The dashboards can be configured to reflect the most important aspects, across levels, 
thereby enabling the senior management to take actions at the right time.</p>
<p>Typical metrics to track could vary, depending on the type of engagements:</p>
<ul className="check-list">
<li>Sprint velocity</li>
<li>Burn down chart</li>
<li>Resource utilization</li>
<li>Defect density</li>
<li>Response time</li>
<li>Resolution time</li>
<li>Uptime</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, all the six elements of the Global Delivery Model: the Engagement Model, Processes, People, Tools, Infrastructure, and Governance have not only become imperative in delivering a faster and cheaper customer experience but also one thats repeatable, predictable and better.
